<h3> The one place for all your classical cipher needs </h3>

	<p>
		Here you will find a wide range of classical ciphers for you to choose from!

		</br>
		Just type in your message and watch as your text turns into a ciphered message,
		which only a few amount of people can decode on their own

<h4> About Classical Ciphers</h4>
	
	<p class="About">
		In cryptography, a classical cipher is a type of cipher that was used historically but now has fallen, 
		for the most part, into disuse. 
		In contrast to modern cryptographic algorithms, 
		most classical ciphers can be practically computed and solved by hand. 
		</br>
		In a substitution cipher, letters (or groups of letters) are systematically replaced throughout the message for other letters (or groups of letters).
		A well-known example of a substitution cipher is the Caesar cipher. To encrypt a message with the Caesar cipher, each 
		letter of message is replaced by the letter three positions later in the alphabet. Hence, A is replaced by D, B by E, C by F, etc.
		Finally, X, Y and Z are replaced by A, B and C respectively. So, for example, "WIKIPEDIA" encrypts as "ZLNLSHGLD". Caesar rotated the 
		alphabet by three letters, but any number works.
